            <bold> Underworld</bold><em>, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. Archeologists have identified Anubis's sacred animal as an Egyptian canid,</em>
            <bold> the African golden wolf.</bold>

            <em>Like many ancient Egyptian deities,</em> <strong>Anubis</strong> <em>assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as</em>
            <bold> the First Dynasty (c. 3100 ‚Äì c. 2890 BC)</bold><em>, Anubis was also an embalmer. By</em>
            <bold> the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055 ‚Äì 1650 BC)</bold><em> he was replaced by</em> <strong>Osiris</strong> <em>in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended
              the
              weighing scale during</em><strong> the "Weighing of the Heart"</strong><em>, in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead.[6] Despite being one of the most ancient and "one of the most
              frequently
              depicted and mentioned gods" in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths.[7]

              Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming.</em><strong> Anubis</strong><em> is associated with his brother</em><strong>
              Wepwawet</strong><em>, another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog's head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined.</em> <strong>Anubis</strong><em>'s female
              counterpart
              is</em><strong> Anput</strong><em>. His daughter is the serpent goddess</em><strong> Kebechet</strong><em>.</em></td>
      <td><strong>"Anubis"</strong> <em>is a Greek rendering of this god's Egyptian name. Before the Greeks arrived in Egypt, around the 7th century BC, the god was known as</em><strong> Anpu</strong><em> or</em><strong> Inpu</strong><em>. The
          root of the name in ancient Egyptian language means</em>
        <bold> " a royal child "</bold><strong> Inpu</strong><em> has a root to</em>
        <bold> " inp "</bold><em> which means</em>
        <bold> " to decay " </bold><em>.The god was also known as "First of the Westerners," "Lord of the Sacred Land," "He Who is Upon his Sacred Mountain," "Ruler of the Nine Bows," "The Dog who Swallows Millions," "Master of Secrets," "He Who
          is in the Place of Embalming," and "Foremost of the Divine Booth." [11] The positions that he had were also reflected in the titles he held such as "He Who Is upon His Mountain," "Lord of the Sacred Land," "Foremost of the Westerners,"
          and "He Who Is in the Place of Embalming."[12] In the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 BC ‚Äì c. 2181 BC), the standard way of writing his name in hieroglyphs was composed of the sound signs inpw followed by a jackal[13] over a ·∏•tp sign:[14]

          A new form with the "jackal" on a tall stand appeared in the late Old Kingdom and became common thereafter:[14]

          <strong>Anubis</strong>' name jnpw was possibly pronounced [a.Ààna.p ∞a(w)], based on Coptic Anoup and the Akkadian transcription íÄÄíàæíâ∫<a-na-pa> in the name <ri-a-na-pa> "Reanapa" that appears in Amarna letter EA 315.[15][16] However, this
              transcription
              may also be interpreted as rÀÅ-nfr, a name similar to that of <strong>Prince Ranefer</strong of the Fourth Dynasty.</em> </td> </td> </p> </table> <p1>

                      underworld.[3] He was the god of the sun, order,

                  <td><em>üêßThe sun as a creator

                      The sun is the giver of life, controlling the ripening of crops which were worked by man. Because of the life giving qualities of the sun the Egyptians worshiped the sun as a god. The creator of the universe and the giver of
                      life, the sun or </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> represented life, warmth and growth. Since the people regarded </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> as a principal god, creator of the universe and the source of life, he had a strong
                      influence on them, which led to him being one of the most worshiped of all the Egyptian gods and even considered</em><strong> King of the Gods</strong><em>. At an early period in Egyptian history his influence spread throughout
                      the whole country, bringing multiple representations in form and in name. The most common form combinations are with </em><strong>Atum</strong><em> (his human form), </em><strong>Khepra</strong><em> (the scarab beetle) and
                    </em><strong>Horus</strong><em> (the falcon). The form in which he usually appears is that of a man with a falcon head, which is due to his combination with </em><strong>Horus</strong><em>, another sky god. On top of his head sits
                      a solar disc with a cobra, which in many myths represents the eye of </em><strong>Ra</strong>. At the beginning of time, when there was nothing but chaos, the sun god existed alone in the watery mass of </em><strong>Nun</strong> which
          filled the universe.[4] "I am Atum when he was alone in</em><strong> Nun</strong><em>, I am </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> when he dawned, when he began to rule that which he had made."[4] This passage talks about how
              </em><strong>Atum</strong><em> created everything in human form out of the chaos and how </em><strong>Ra</strong> then began to rule over the earth where humans and divine beings coexisted. He had to children at first.[5] The siblings
              symbolized two universal principles of humans: life and right (justice). </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> was believed to have created all forms of life by calling them into existence by uttering their secret names. In some accounts humans
                were created from </em><strong>Ra</strong><em>'s tears and sweat.[4] According to one myth the first portion of Earth came into being when the sun god summoned it out of the watery mass of </em><strong>Nun</strong><em>. In the myth of
              </em><strong>the Celestial Cow</strong> (the sky was thought of as a huge cow, the goddess </em><strong>Meht-urt</strong><em>) it is recounted how mankind plotted against</em><strong> Ra</strong> <em>and how he sent his eye as the
                goddess </em><strong>Sekhmet</strong><em> to punish them. Extensions of </em><strong>Ra</strong><em>'s power were often shown as the eye of</em><strong> Ra</strong><em>, which were the female versions of the sun god.
              </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> had three daughters </em><strong>Bastet</strong><em>,</em><strong> Sekhmet</strong><em>, and</em><strong> Hathor</strong><em> who were all considered the eye of</em><strong> Ra</strong><em> who would seek
                out his vengeance.</em><strong> Sekhmet</strong><em> was</em> the Eye of Ra</strong><em> and was created by the fire in</em><strong>Ra</strong><em>'s eye. She was violent and sent to slaughter the people who betrayed</em><strong> Ra</strong><em>, but when calm she became the more kind and forgiving goddess
              </em><strong>Hathor</strong><em>. </em><strong>Sekhmet</strong><em> was the powerful warrior and protector while</em><strong>Bastet</strong><em>, who was depicted as a cat, was shown as gentle and nurturing.
              In the underworld

            </em><strong>  Ra</strong><em> was thought to travel on the</em><strong> Atet</strong><em>, two solar barques called </em><strong>the Mandjet (the Boat of Millions of Years)</strong><em> or</em><strong> morning boat</strong><em> and</em><strong> the Mesektet</strong><em></em><strong> evening boat</strong><em>. These boats took him on his journey through the sky and the </em><strong>Duat</strong><em>, the
              literal underworld of Egypt. While </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> was on the</em><strong> Mesektet</strong><em>, he was in his ram-headed form. When </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> traveled in his sun boat, he was accompanied by various other deities including </em><strong>Sia</strong><em> (perception) and </em><strong>Hu</strong><em> (command), as well as</em><strong> Heka</strong>
<em>              (magic power). Sometimes, members of </em><strong>the Ennead</strong> <em>helped him on his journey, including </em><strong>Set</strong><em>, who overcame the serpent</em><strong> Apophis</strong><em>, and </em><strong>Mehen</strong><em>, who defended against the monsters of the underworld. When</em><strong> Ra</strong><em> was in the underworld, he would visit
              all of his various forms.

          </em><strong>    Apophis</strong><em>, the god of chaos, was an enormous serpent who attempted to stop the sun boat's journey every night by consuming it or by stopping it in its tracks with a hypnotic stare. During the evening, the Egyptians believed that</em><strong> Ra</strong><em> set as
          </em><strong>Atum</strong><em> or in the form of a ram. The night boat would carry him through the underworld and back towards the east in preparation for his rebirth. These myths of</em><strong> Ra</strong><em> represented the sun rising as the rebirth of the sun by the sky goddess</em><strong> Nut</strong><em>;
              thus attributing the concept of rebirth and renewal to</em><strong> Ra</strong><em> and strengthening his role as a creator god as well.

              When </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> was in the underworld, he merged with </em><strong>Osiris</strong><em>, the god of the dead.

      <td><strong>Horus</strong><em> or </em><strong>Her</strong><em>,</em><strong>Horus</strong><em> or</em><strong> Her</strong><em>,</em><strong> Heru</strong><em>,</em><strong> Hor</strong><em> in Ancient Egyptian, is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities who served many functions, most notably god of kingship and the sky. He was worshipped from at least the late prehistoric Egypt until </em><strong>the Ptolemaic Kingdom</strong><em> and</em><strong> Roman Egypt</strong>. <em>Different forms of </em><strong>Horus</strong><em> are recorded in history and these are treated as distinct gods by Egyptologists. These various forms may possibly be different manifestations of the same multi-layered deity in which certain attributes or syncretic relationships are emphasized, not necessarily in opposition but complementary to one another, consistent with how the Ancient Egyptians viewed the multiple facets of reality. He was most often depicted as a falcon, most likely a lanner falcon or peregrine falcon, or as a man with a falcon head.

The earliest recorded form of </EM><strong>Horus</strong><em> is the tutelary deity of </em><strong>Nekhen</strong><em> in Upper Egypt, who is the first known national god, specifically related to the ruling pharaoh who in time came to be regarded as a manifestation of</em><strong> Horus</strong><em> in life and</em><strong> Osiris</strong><em> in death. The most commonly encountered family relationship describes</em><strong> Horus</strong><em> as the son of </em><strong>Isis</strong><em> and </em><strong>Osiris</strong><em>, and he plays a key role in the</em><strong> Osiris</strong><em> myth as</em><strong> Osiris</strong><em>'s heir and the rival to</em> <strong>Set</strong><em>, the murderer of</em><strong> Osiris</strong><em>. In another tradition </em><strong>Hathor</strong><em> is regarded as his mother and sometimes as his wife.</em>
</td>
<td><em>The Pyramid Texts (c. 2400‚Äì2300 BC) describe the nature of the pharaoh in different characters as both</em> <strong>Horus</strong><em> and</em><strong></strong><em> Osiris</strong><em>. The pharaoh as </em><strong>Horus</strong><em> in life became the pharaoh as</em><strong> Osiris</strong><em> in death, where he was united with the other gods. New incarnations of </em><strong>Horus</strong><em> succeeded the deceased pharaoh on earth in the form of new pharaohs.

</em><strong>The lineage of Horus</strong><em>, the eventual product of unions between the children of</em><strong> Atum</strong><em>, may have been a means to explain and justify pharaonic power. The gods produced by </em><strong>Atum</strong><em> were all representative of cosmic and terrestrial forces in Egyptian life. By identifying</em><strong> Horus>/strong><em> as the offspring of these forces, then identifying him with</em><strong> Atum</strong><em> himself, and finally identifying the Pharaoh with </em><strong>Horus</strong><em>, the Pharaoh theologically had dominion over all the world.

The notion of</em><strong> Horus</strong><em> as the pharaoh seems to have been superseded by the concept of the pharaoh as the son of </em><strong>Ra</strong><em> during the Fifth Dynasty.</em></td>
